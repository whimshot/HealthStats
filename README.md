# Health Stats

A little Kivy/Python program for recording basic health statistics (weight, bp, and pulse). The statistics are stored on io.adafruit.com. Right now it is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a Raspbery Pi Touch Screen.

## Getting Started

If you are really interested feel free to download and take a look. The requirements files are for Python 2.7 and 3 and should be up to date (should be).

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python and Kivy and some Python modules.

*   adafruit-io version 1.1.0
*   certifi version 2017.4.17
*   chardet version 3.0.4
*   cycler version 0.10.0
*   Cython version 0.25.2
*   docutils version 0.13.1
*   idna version 2.5
*   Kivy version 1.10.0
*   Kivy-Garden version 0.1.4
*   matplotlib version 2.0.2
*   mccabe version 0.6.1
*   numpy version 1.13.0

```
pip install --upgrade -r requirements3.txt
```

### Installing

You'll need to create a file called *AdafruitIOKey.py* (or whatever you like just change the import line). And it should look something like this:

*AdafruitIOKey.py*:

```
aoi_key = 'Your key goes here'
```

## Running the tests

Right now there aren't any tests.

### Break down into end to end tests

### And coding style tests

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
